        <h2><span class="roast-name">Jason</span>'s Roast:</h2>
        <p>We are doing this roast tonight to help <span class="roast-name">Jason</span> live out one of <span class="roast-poss">his</span> sexual fantasies, to have a room full of <span class="roast-poss">his</span> friends shit all over him.</p>
        
        <p>A little known fact is that a long time ago <span class="roast-name">Jason</span> used to work at McDonald’s. It was the last time anyone said about your work, "I’m lovin' it."</p>
        
          <p>This is exciting <span class="roast-name">Jason</span> right?? Well tell your face.</p>
        
        <p><span class="roast-name">Jason</span> if laughter is the best medicine, your face must be curing the world.</p>
        
        <p>It’s nice to see such a diverse crowd here today. We’ve got Indians, Jews, Whites, and whatever the fuck <span class="roast-name">Jason</span> is. </p>
